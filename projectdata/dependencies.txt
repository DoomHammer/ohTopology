#
# Each line should have the format:
# "NAME" "SOURCE" "TARGET" "CONFIGURE_ARGS"
#
# NAME - the name of the dependency, referenced in build.py
# SOURCE - the location of the .tar.gz file containing the dependency files
# TARGET - the location to unpack the dependency archive
# CONFIGURE_ARGS - extra arguments to pass to waf configure
#
# Lines are processed like shell arguments, so use double
# quotes if there are spaces and escape quotes and backslashes
# with backslashes.
#
# ${OHNET_ARTIFACTS} expands to the location of the OhNet artifacts share.
# ${OH_PLATFORM} expands to the name of the target platform, e.g. "Windows-x86" or "Linux-ARM".
